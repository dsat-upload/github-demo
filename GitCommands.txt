1) To create username and email
git config --global user.name "bla bla"
git config --global user.email "tla@bla.com"

2) To check git config info
git config --global --list

3) git clone <https link of the repo from the github remote repo>

4)git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

origin/master is the branch on the github repo

5) There are three stages on our local repo
working directory/  [git add <file> ->]               staged area  [git commit -m ""<file> ->]   commited
unstages area       [git restore --staged <file> <-] 

6) When local repo new code is pushed to the remote repo, the content of the remote repo must be upto date on the local repo. Else git will error out and notifies it to the user

bash-5.0$ git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': dsat-upload            
Password for 'https://dsat-upload@github.com': 
To https://github.com/dsat-upload/github-demo.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dsat-upload/github-demo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

7) So first, pull the contents of the remote repo first to update the local repo.
git pull
provide the merge comments.
then run git push origin master to push your code to remote repo

8) To create a repo
git init <repo name>

When ls -al is run under the repo folder, .git directory appears which confirms that a repo is created and git manages this

9) Say you already have a folder and bunch of files under that. But this folder is not managed by git. 
Run git init in that folder. This instructs the git to mamage this folder, and .git directory must appear. 

10) rm -rf .git 
This will remove the .git directory hence telling git not to manage the folder anymore.
